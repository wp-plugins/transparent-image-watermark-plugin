Automatically watermark images as they are uploaded to the WordPress Media Library.



== Description ==
This plugin allows you to Automatically add a watermark to all images as they are uploaded to the WordPress Media Library.
The plugin uses PNG watermark images with transparency for precise control over the appearance of the watermarks.
This plugin also supports simple text watermarks with adjustable color, size and transparency.
The user friendly settings page allows for control over the appearance of your watermark.  
The watermark preview feature allows for easy testing of the plugin settings.
The watermark size is controlled as a percentage of the target image, 50% means the watermark will be half the width of the target image. 
Watermarks are now removable with the new backup system, any images watermarked while the new backup system is enabled are able to be restored to the original image.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin doesn't work ... =

Please specify as much information as you can to help us debug the problem. 
Check in your error log if you can. 
Please send screenshots as well as a detailed description of the problem.



= Error message says that I don't have GD extension installed =

Contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable GD extension for your host,  GD extension is required for watermarking.



= Error message says that I need to enable the allow_url_fopen option =

Contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable allow_url_fopen, most likely in your php.ini  
It may be necessary to create a php.ini file inside of the wp-admin directory to enable the allow_url_fopen option.

You can also use a relative url path as a workaround, an example is provided on the settings page.


= How do I Remove Watermarks? =

This plugin permanently alters the images to contain the watermarks, so the watermarks can not be removed. 
If you want to simply test this plugin, or think you may want to remove the watermarks, you need to make a backup of your images before you use the plugin to add watermarks.

= How can I Add Watermarks to images that were uploaded before the plugin was installed? = 

We have a premium version of this plugin that adds the capability to manually add watermarks to images in the WordPress Media Library.

= How can I Adjust the Location of the Watermarks? = 

We have a premium version of this plugin that adds the capability to adjust the location of the watermarks.
The position can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally.

* Lifetime Priority Support and Update License




= How do I generate the Highest Quality Watermarks? = 

We recommend that your watermark image be roughly the same width as the largest images you plan to watermark.
That way the watermark image will be scaled down, which will work better than making the watermark image larger in order to fit.

We also have a premium version of this plugin that adds the capability to resample the watermark image, rather than simply resize it.
This results in significantly better looking watermarks.
